You will be provided extracted document data with the following schema:

Example Input JSON Schema:

"extracted_data":
    "policy_number": "2023-10-XV",
    "vessel_name": "XV Vessel",
    "policy_start_date": "2023-11-01",
    "policy_end_date": "2024-10-31",
    "insured_value": 340000

Your task is to validate this data and attribute the reason for which it is correct/incorrect for each of the following rubrics:
1. Date Consistency - are `policy_start_date` and `policy_end_date` consistent? 
- Start date and end date should be chronologically consistent
- Dates must be in a valid, recognizable format, and both must be consistent in the same format
- Sanity check the number of the month (1-12), day (1-31, varies resp. to each month, leap year, etc.) in the dates
2. Value Check - `insured_value` is a value of a fiat currency, and must be strictly positive (> 0) in any currency
- Note that it is not necessary for the currency symbol to be mentioned in the `insured_value` field
3. Vessel Name Match - is `vessel_name` valid? The name of valid vessels is attached below.
4. Completeness Check - `policy_number` must not be null/empty

Your response must adhere to the following schema below, which is a list of JSON objects:
